A simple console-based Library Management System built using C++.
# Library Management System

## Overview
This is a console-based Library Management System implemented in C++. The system allows users to perform various library-related functions such as:

- Registering users
- Adding new books to the library
- Searching for books by title
- Borrowing and returning books
- Managing waiting lists for borrowed books
- Rating books and viewing average ratings
- Listing all books in the library (sorted by title)

## Features
- **User Registration:** Users can be registered by their name.
- **Book Management:** Admins can add books with titles and authors to the library.
- **Book Borrowing:** Users can borrow books, which will be marked as borrowed.
- **Book Returning:** Users can return books and if returned late, a penalty is calculated.
- **Waiting List:** If a book is borrowed, other users can join the waiting list.
- **Book Rating:** Users can rate books on a scale of 1-5.
- **Book Search:** Users can search for books by title and view their status, ratings, and waiting list.
